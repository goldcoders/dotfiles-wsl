# WSL Ubuntu - Tmux - Alacritty - Nvim - Ranger - ZSH

> Top notch productivity workflow on windows wslg

I get tired of using windows terminal , since they wont even let me use tmux which i used in Linux, MacOs.

Ranger File Manager will use to launch any windows apps inside terminal depending on the default windows apps for each extensions

Also i hate using mouse to browse my files and navigate explorer so using ranger with custom built shortcuts makes it a breeze

Also my NVIM Config is Fucked up with windows terminal it constantly freeze for pressing keys that i use a lot like x , v d , p

I use this for developing native linux app in Ubuntu with Flutter side by side with Native Desktop App for windows with flutter
